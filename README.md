# OpenForge

A customizable mock data generator.

## Overview

OpenForge is a highly customizable reaslistic mock data generator.
Our website uses in-house API to fulfill our client's requests. If neccessary, we also utilize the API of various external data generators, aggregate that and intergrate it with our database responses before we deliver it back to our clients into a textbox where they can choose to copy or download it in JSON or CSV form.

Additionally our clients can login if they want to 'favorite' a complex arrangment of data they expect to use regularily.

### Built with

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Express.js
- Axios.js
- vanilla CSS
- Babel
- webpack

### Continued development

- Add a documentation page so users can use the api directly without our frontend
- Add more data types to choose from
- Have data returned in order of selection
- Add dark mode
