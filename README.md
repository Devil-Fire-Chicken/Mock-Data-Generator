# OpenForge

A customizable mock data generator.

Originally Created by Yeti Crabs Inc.

## Overview

OpenForge is a highly customizable realistic mock data generator.
Our website uses an in-house API to fulfill our client's requests. If necessary, we also utilize the API of various external data generators, aggregate that and integrate it with our database responses before we deliver it back to our clients into a textbox where they can copy or download it in JSON or CSV form.

Additionally, our clients can log in if they want to 'favorite' a complex arrangement of data they expect to use regularly.

### Built with

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Express.js
- Axios
- vanilla CSS
- Babel
- webpack

### Continued development

- Add a documentation page so users can use the API directly without our frontend
- Add more data types to choose from
- Have data returned in order of selection
- Add dark mode
